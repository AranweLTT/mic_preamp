## General description

The LE100 preamp is a multistage transistor based microphone amplifier. It is built around the BC848 NPN transistor and is designed to boost a microphone signal to a suitable level for an ADC converter.

The main advantages over a fully integrated solution like an IC are the customizability and simplicity of this solution. It is also a great learning opportunity to get familiar with transistor amplifiers, which is why there are multiple probe points and jumpers to provide per-stage debugging.
